  Show that the isomorphism relation $A \cong B$ for ordered sets is an 
  equivalence relation, that is:\\
  (a) $A \cong A$ for any ordered set $A$. (b) If $A \cong B$, then $B \cong A$. 
  (c) If $A \cong B$ and $B \cong C$, then $A \cong C$.
\end{problem}

\begin{solution}
  (a) Define $f: A \rightarrow A$ by $f = \{ (a,a): a \in A \}$, then\\
  $~~~~~~~(i)~$If $a \precsim a'$, then $f(a) \precsim f(a')$,\\
  $~~~~~~(ii)~$If $a || a'$, then $f(a) || f(a')$,\\
  $~~~~~~$Thus $A \cong A$;\\
  (b) Define $g: A \rightarrow B$ that preserves the order relation,\\
  $~~~~~~$Since $A \cong B$, $g$ is a bijection, $g^{-1}(g(x)) = x$,\\
  $~~~~~~$And $a \precsim a' \Leftrightarrow g(a) \precsim g(a')$, $a || a' \Leftrightarrow g(a) || g(a')$,\\
  $~~~~~~~(i)~$From $a \precsim a' \Leftrightarrow g(a) \precsim g(a')$ we 
  can conclude that\\
  $~~~~~~~~~~~~\forall b,b' \in B$, if $b \precsim b'$, then $g^{-1}(b) \precsim g^{-1}(b')$,\\

  $~~~~~~~~~~~~\forall b,b' \in B$, if $b || b'$, then $g^{-1}(b) || g^{-1}(b')$;\\
  $~~~~~~$Thus $g^{-1}$ preserves the order relation,\\
  $~~~~~~$Thus $B \cong A$;\\
  (c) Define $f: A \rightarrow B$ and $g: B \rightarrow C$ that preserve the order relations,\\
  $~~~~~~$Since $A \cong B$, $B \cong C$, $f$ and $g$ are both bijections,\\
  $~~~~~~$Thus $g \circ f$ is a bijection, $(g \circ f)(x) = g(f(x))$,\\
  $~~~~~~~(i)~$From $a \precsim a' \Rightarrow f(a) \precsim f(a')$, 
  $f(a) \precsim f(a') \Rightarrow g(f(a)) \precsim g(f(a'))$ we can conclude that\\

  $~~~~~~(ii)~$From $a || a' \Rightarrow f(a) || f(a')$, $f(a) || f(a') \Rightarrow g(f(a)) || g(f(a'))$ 
  we can conclude that\\
  $~~~~~~~~~~~~\forall a,a' \in A$, if $a || a'$, then $g(f(a)) || g(f(a'))$;\\

\begin{problem}[SM: 14.62]
  Suppose A and B are well-ordered isomorphic sets. Show that there is only one similarity mapping f : A → B.
\end{problem}

\begin{solution}
  Since $A$ and $B$ are both well-ordered,\\
  Denote $a_{0}$, $b_{0}$ as the first element of $A$ and $B$ respectively,\\
  Let $a_{i+1}$, $b_{i+1}$ be the cover of $a_{i}$ and $b_{i}$ respectively
  ($i \geq 0$, $i \in \mathbb{Z}$),\\
  Since $A$ and $B$ are isomorphic,\\
  We can easily find a similarity mapping $f = \{ (a_{i},b_{i}): a_{i} \in A,~b_{i} \in B,
  ~i \geq 0,~i \in \mathbb{Z} \}$,\\
  Suppose we can define another similarity mapping $g: A \rightarrow B$,\\
  Then $g(A) \subseteq B$,\\
  By transfinite induction, we have that\\
  $~(i)~g(a_{0}) \in B$;\\
  $(ii)~\forall i \geq 0$, $g(a_{i+k}) > g(a_{i})$ ($k > 0,~k \in \mathbb{Z}$),\\
  $~~~~~~$And $\{ g(a_{i+k}): k > 0,~k \in \mathbb{Z} \} \subseteq B$,\\
  $~~~~~~$Thus $g(a_{i}) \in B$;\\
  Then $g(A) = B$.\\
  Thus $g(a_{0}) = b_{0}$,\\
  Since $g(a_{i+1})$ is the cover of $g(a_{i})$,\\
  We have that $g(a_{i}) = b_{i}$,\\
  Thus $f = g$,\\
  Thus there is only one similarity mapping $f: A \rightarrow B$.

\begin{problem}[SM: 14.75]
  A lattice M is said to be modular if whenever a ≤ c we have the law\\
$~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~$a ∨ (b ∧ c) = (a ∨ b) ∧ c\\
(a) Prove that every distributive lattice is modular.\\
(b) Verify that the non-distributive lattice in Fig. 14-7(b) is modular; hence the converse of (a) is not true.\\
(c) Show that the nondistributive lattice in Fig. 14-7(a) is non-modular. (In fact, one can prove that every non-modular
lattice contains a sublattice isomorphic to Fig. 14-7(a).)
\end{problem}

\begin{solution}
  (a) If $a \leq c$, then $a \vee c = c$,\\
  $~~~~~~$If $M$ is distributive, then\\
  $~~~~~~a \vee (b \wedge c) = (a \vee b) \wedge (a \vee c)$\\
  $~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~= (a \vee b) \wedge c$.\\
  (b) $0 \vee (a \wedge b) = 0 = (0 \vee a) \wedge b$, thus $\forall x,y \in \{ a,b,c \}$, 
  $0 \vee (x \wedge y) = (0 \vee x) \wedge y$;\\
  $~~~~~~0 \vee (a \wedge I) = a = (0 \vee a) \wedge I = (0 \vee I) \wedge a$, 
  thus $\forall x \in \{ a,b,c \}$, $0 \vee (x \wedge I) = (0 \vee x) \wedge I = (0 \vee I) \wedge x$;\\
  $~~~~~~a \vee (b \wedge I) = I = (a \vee b) \wedge I$, thus $\forall x,y \in \{ a,b,c \}$, 
  $x \vee (y \wedge I) = (x \vee y) \wedge I$.\\
  $~~~~~~$Thus $\forall a,b,c \in M$ that satisfy $a \leq c$, we have $a \vee (b \wedge c) = (a \vee b) \wedge c$,\\
  $~~~~~~$Namely $M$ is modular.\\
  (c) Here $a \vee (b \wedge c) = a$, $(a \vee b) \wedge c = c$,\\
  $~~~~~~$Thus $M$ is not modular.
